# GUI Calendar

Write a Python program to create a GUI calendar, similar to the one discussed in class, in which **SUNDAY is the first day of the week**. (In our class example, Monday is the first day of the week.) Also use the command line argument parser (argparser) so a user can enter an arbitrary month and year to display the calendar. Name your Python program `cal.py`. For example, when the user execute:

```
python cal.py -y 2017 -m 8
```

Your program is supposed to display a GUI calendar window, with Monday to be the first day of the week. Once completed and tested, push your program back to GitHub, e.g.

```
git add cal.py
git commit -m "GUI calendar assignment"
git push
```
